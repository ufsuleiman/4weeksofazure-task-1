            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>As an undergraduate student majoring in Petroleum Engineering, I am deeply committed to bridging the gap between traditional engineering practices and cutting-edge technology.  I am passionate about the transformative potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am actively engaged in learning these technologies with the goal of applying them to solve complex engineering problems. My focus areas include training machine models to perform regression analysis, data clustering, data classification, and time series forecasting.

In addition to my technical skills, I am certified in project management, equipping me with the ability to efficiently manage and execute projects from inception to completion. This certification complements my engineering studies and supports my holistic approach to problem-solving.

Looking ahead, my aspiration is to develop a simulation package in my final year that predicts the behavior of reservoir rocks and petroleum fluids. This project represents the culmination of my academic journey and my dedication to contributing innovative solutions to the field of petroleum engineering.

Driven by curiosity and a desire to innovate, I am eager to connect with professionals and peers who share my passion for engineering and technology..</p>
